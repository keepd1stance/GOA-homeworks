            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p align="center">The gameplay of the Mario & Luigi series consists of mostly role-playing elements; however,
            the Mario & Luigi games do differ from most other RPGs in its focus on controlling Mario and Luigi simultaneously. 
            During overworld sections, the player controls Mario's movement with Luigi following closely. 
            Mario and Luigi's other actions are controlled individually with the A (Mario) and B (Luigi) buttons respectively in both the overworld and battle sections. 
            These controls are also used to explore the overworld to solve puzzles and find collectibles using various special moves that often have Mario and Luigi working together. 
            Like many other RPG series, the Mario & Luigi series contains a traditional turn-based battle system. It also uses Action Commands, similarly to the Paper Mario franchise. 
            These actions consist of Mario's and Luigi's signature jumps, as well as hammer attacks. Unique to the series is the use of real-time commands while an enemy is attacking so that if the player uses successful timing, they can completely avoid an attack or even do damage to the enemy instead of getting hit. 
            This mechanism encourages the player to learn enemy's attack patterns and proper timing. Some titles in the series feature additional characters alongside Mario and Luigi; these include Baby Mario and Baby Luigi in Partners in Time, Bowser in Bowser’s Inside Story, and Paper Mario in Paper Jam.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <strong>2000–2003: AlphaDream founding, conception and first game</strong>
            <p>AlphaDream was founded in 2000 by former employees from Square including Chihiro Fujioka, director of Super Mario RPG, and Tetsuo Mizuno, Square's second president.[4][5][6] Square had previously developed Super Mario RPG, the first role-playing game (RPG) starring characters from the Mario series. After a number of smaller games, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga was their first game to be released outside of Japan.
                The Mario & Luigi series took inspiration from Super Mario RPG when it came to turn-based combat. Yoshihiko Maekawa, a producer at AlphaDream who also co-directed Super Mario RPG, noted how the latter was inspired by a children's toy in Japan where the player had to press buttons in time with music. From there he conceptualized turn-based mechanics that blended action with general RPG gameplay, where the player had to make timed button presses to be more successful. It was there the developers knew they were creating an RPG game that had a Mario feel. Transitioning to the Mario & Luigi series, AlphaDream revisited the timed button pressing combat system, making additions for the first game in the series, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. Each game following, they experimented more with the buttons available, making further additions as the series progressed.[3]    
                When it came to characters in Mario franchise at the time, they were generally underdeveloped. Since Mario & Luigi is mainly based on a text-based story, AlphaDream approached Nintendo with the mindset of revamping characters such as Luigi. With Nintendo's approval and support, the characters and their depth were developed from scratch.</p>
